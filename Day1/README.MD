# Day 1 -- The Fizz Buzz Challenge
Question- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”, and for the numbers which are divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz
